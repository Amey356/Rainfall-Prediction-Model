# Rainfall-Prediction-Model

## Project Overview

### Objective of the Project
The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether it will rain tomorrow based on various weather parameters. This predictive capability can significantly enhance decision-making in fields such as agriculture, event planning, and emergency management.

### Dataset Source and Description
The dataset used for this project is the `WeatherAUS.csv` obtained from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. This dataset contains daily weather observations for various locations across Australia. It includes key columns such as `Date`, `Location`, `MinTemp`, `MaxTemp`, `Rainfall`, `Evaporation`, `Sunshine`, and `Wind Gust Direction`, providing ample data for analysis and model training.

### Key Dataset Characteristics
- **Rows**: 142,193
- **Columns**: 24
- **Features**: Numerical (e.g., `MinTemp`, `MaxTemp`, `Rainfall`, `WindSpeed`), Categorical (e.g., `Location`, `RainToday`, `WindGustDir`)
- **Target Variable**: `RainTomorrow` (binary classification: `Yes/No`)
- **Challenges**: Missing values, data cleaning required

## Data Preprocessing

### Handling Missing Values
To manage missing values within the dataset, various strategies will be implemented:
- For numerical features like `Evaporation` and `Sunshine`, missing values will be imputed using statistical measures such as mean or median.
- For critical features with a significant amount of missing data, rows may be dropped or replaced to maintain dataset integrity and prevent bias in model training.

### Encoding Categorical Variables
Categorical variables like `Location`, `RainToday`, and `WindGustDir` will be encoded to be effectively used in machine learning models:
- **Label Encoding**: Assigns each category a unique integer.
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Creates binary columns for each category.

## Model Training and Evaluation Process

### Data Splitting
- The dataset will be split into training and test sets (typically an 80/20 split) for effective evaluation.

### Model Training
- The selected models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) will be trained on the training dataset to learn patterns and make predictions based on the data.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- **GridSearchCV** and **RandomizedSearchCV** will be utilized to optimize hyperparameters for models like Random Forest and XGBoost to enhance performance.

### Cross-Validation
- Cross-validation will be performed to ensure the model's performance is stable and reliable, reducing overfitting and improving generalization.
